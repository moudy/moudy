## BroccolliJS?
a great way to serve assets in development and bundle up for production
not a task runner like grunt/gulp
grunt/gulp still useful sometimes

grunt/gulp still useful sometimes

## The Simplest Example
serve a JS file with no changes

## Connect to Express App
- set assset host based on env in middleware
- asset url view helper

## Configure for Production
- minify
- only minify based on env
- broccili build assets in postinstall (heroku)

## Using Plugins
- sass
- browseify
