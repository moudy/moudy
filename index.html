  <div class="about-me">
    <p>
      I'm a programmer excited by the intersection of art &amp; technology. I mainly mainly work with JavaScript, Ruby and sometimes Objective-C when no one is looking.

    TODO - put 3 photos across here that are random on page load

    <p>
      When not programming I like taking pictures.
